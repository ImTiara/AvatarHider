# AvatarHider
This mod will automatically hide avatars based on the distance away from you.
There's no real reason to render avatars that you don't even pay attention to, right?

For the best experience, it is recommended to run this mod with UIExpansionKit.
"Hide Distance" is customizable and can be changed in meters (default is 7 meters).
Friend's avatars are ignored by default, but can be hidden by distance too if needed.
"Exclude Shown Avatars" will ignore to hide a persons avatar if you are showing the avatar.
"Disable Spawn Sounds" will only prevent a spawn sound from replaying when the avatar becomes visable again.

Tip:
If a friend is using an unoptimized avatar and you would like AvatarHider to hide it, disable "Ignore Friends" and enable "Exclude Shown Avatars".
Then show your friends avatars that you would like to be ignored by AvatarHider.
And set the friend with the unoptimized avatar to the "Use Safety Settings" in the QuickMenu.
