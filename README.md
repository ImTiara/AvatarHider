# AvatarHider
This mod will automatically hide avatars based on the distance away from you.
There's no real reason to render avatars that you don't even pay attention to, right?

For the best experience, it is recommended to run this mod with UIExpansionKit.
"Hide Distance" is customizable and can be changed in meters (default is 7 meters).
Friend's avatars are ignored by default, but can be hidden by distance too if needed.
